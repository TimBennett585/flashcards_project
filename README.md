## Flashcard Study System 

>This app is a flashcard study system for a student to use.
>It allows the student to create their own "decks" to study from, as well as a title/description for each.
>The student will also be able to edit a deck description, delete decks from their site and add cards to the decks.
>The cards will have a front and back, as is traditional with flashcards, and they can also be edited or deleted after creation.
